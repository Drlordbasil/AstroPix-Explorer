# Real-world logic additions:

# 1. Implemented error handling and logging for network errors.
# 2. Added multi-threading for faster image fetching and saving.
# 3. Cleaned up outdated images in the image folder after a specified number of days.
# 4. Added a log file to track progress and errors.
# 5. Removed the image format filtering for simplicity, can be added if required.
# 6. Avoided redownloading already fetched images.
# 7. Handled cases where image URLs lead to non-existent or broken images.
# 8. Included functionality to delete unused or outdated images.
# 9. Added concurrent.futures.ThreadPoolExecutor for concurrent image saving.
# 10. Used logging module for error tracking.
# 11. Added creation time check for deleting outdated images.
# 12. Added more detailed error messages in logging.
